description: "Trust Atlas methodology — four independent pillars with pillar-specific confidence tiers"

# Trust is multidimensional. We track four pillars independently:
# - interpersonal: trust in other people
# - institutional: trust in government/institutions
# - governance: institutional quality metrics
# - media: trust in news media
# Each pillar has its own data sources, methodology constraints, and confidence tier

pillars:
  interpersonal:
    description: "Trust in other people - 'most people can be trusted' binary question"
    methodology: "WVS-family sources with identical question wording"
    precedence: "WVS primary; EVS supplements where WVS has no data"
    sources:
      - name: WVS
        full_name: World Values Survey
        coverage: "108 countries, 1981-2023"
        question: "Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted?"
        scale: binary
        role: primary
      - name: EVS
        full_name: European Values Study
        coverage: "47 countries, 1981-2021"
        question: Same wording (harmonized via IVS)
        scale: binary
        role: supplementary (fills gaps where WVS has no data)
      - name: GSS
        full_name: General Social Survey
        coverage: "USA, 1972-2024"
        question: Same wording (Rosenberg 1956)
        scale: binary
      - name: ANES
        full_name: American National Election Studies
        coverage: "USA, 1958-2024"
        question: Same wording
        scale: binary
      - name: CES
        full_name: Canadian Election Study
        coverage: "Canada, 2008-2021"
        question: Same wording
        scale: binary
    excluded:
      - name: ESS
        reason: "0-10 scale produces systematically different scores"
      - name: Regional Barometers
        reason: "Varied scales (binary, 4-point) and question wording"
      - name: OECD
        reason: "Different institutional definitions"

  institutional:
    description: "Trust in government and public institutions"
    methodology: "WVS-family only"
    sources:
      - name: WVS
        full_name: World Values Survey
        coverage: "108 countries, 1981-2023"

        full_name: Canadian Election Study
        coverage: "Canada, 2008-2021"
    excluded:
      - name: EVS
        reason: "Inconsistent variable coverage. Some waves use E069_11 (government), others only E069_13 (parties). CZE 1991 example: 47.7% gov trust (WVS) vs 23.8% party trust (EVS) - different constructs, cannot reconcile."
      - name: ESS
        reason: "Different question wording and 0-10 scale"
      - name: Asian Barometer
        reason: "Wave 1-2 used inverted scales (10% vs 95% in later waves)"
      - name: Latinobarometer
        reason: "Methodology changes produced 25%→93% swings"

    description: "Trust in news media"
    methodology: "Weighted average of available sources"
    sources:

        scale: percent agreeing
        weight: 0.4
        role: primary (global)
        note: "Data starts 2015 when Reuters introduced the standardized trust question. Earlier reports (2012-2014) used different methodology and questions, making cross-country comparison impossible."
      - name: Eurobarometer
        full_name: Standard Eurobarometer
        coverage: "32 EU/candidate countries, 2024"
        question: "Trust in institutions: Media (QA6_1)"
        scale: binary (tend to trust / tend not to trust)
        weight: 0.4
        role: primary (EU)
        note: "Covers EU member states and candidate countries. Same trust battery as government/parliament questions."
      - name: WVS
        full_name: World Values Survey
        coverage: "100+ countries, 1981-2023"
        question: "Confidence in the press / Confidence in television (E069_07/08)"
        scale: "4-point (great deal, quite a lot, not very much, none at all)"
        weight: 0.2
        role: supplementary
        note: "Provides historical depth back to 1981. Measures 'confidence in' rather than 'trust in' media."
